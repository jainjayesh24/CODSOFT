# DATA Science Projects

## About the internship:
I have been learning about various data science concepts and techniques, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and data visualization. I believe that applying these skills to real-world projects would be the next step in my learning journey.
Building data science projects at Codsoft would not only allow me to apply and enhance my skills but also contribute to the company. 



## Learning Outcomes
EDA and Data science can lead to the ability to enhance Data efficiency.
1. It provides Data Understanding
2. Data Cleaning Skills
3. Feature Scaling and Statistical Data Analysis
4. Data Visualization
5. Critical Thinking skills
6. Model Building Skills

## Summary
EDA is a critical step in any data science project. It involves analyzing and investigating datasets to understand their main characteristics, often using data visualization methods. EDA can help us gain valuable insights from our data, identify interesting patterns, detect anomalies, and test hypotheses.
Here are some projects that I have created in this internship:
•	Titanic Survival Prediction
•	Iris Flower Classification
•	Sales Prediction Using Python
